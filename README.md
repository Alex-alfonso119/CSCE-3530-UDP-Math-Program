# UDP-Math-Program
UDP Client-Server string parsing math program

This is an individual programming assignment I created for my computer networks class at UNT (CSCE 3530)

It is a UDP client-server model in which the server parses a mathmatical expression received from the client.
It processes the message, calculates the expression using a stack, then sends the result back to the client.
